## Project Description
&emsp; Our web service, L&D Country Search,  makes use of the “REST Countries” RESTful API in order to provide a way for travelers (or other users) to retrieve information about a given country, such as its currency, official language(s), as well as its capital, etc. The user will also be able to input a specific field (for instance, currency) and to see which country(ies) match that inputted field.

&emsp; Our goal is to address the difficulty of retrieving important and basic information about a country quickly, efficiently, and in a quick manner.

&emsp; Our UI is extremely user friendly, allowing people of all kind to look for the information that want. All they need to do is to sign up, sign in, and select which field they would like to look for (they can select it from a list provided in the form of a dropdown), and to input a specific value (if applicable) corresponding to the field that they are looking for. For example, they could first select "Country Name" from the dropdown, then write "Canada" in the input value, and they would be returned with the API's information about the country name matching "Canada" once they press the search button. If there are no results available, they will also be alerted and told to try a different input / value combination.
